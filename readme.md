# solparse-antlr

Antlr-based Parser for the Solidity Programming language.

This is spin-off of [Federico Bond's solidity-parser-antlr](https://github.com/federicobond/solidity-parser-antlr)

## Note

solparse-antlr is primarily meant for [Solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium). It is subject to surprise breaking changes because its sole purpose is to make life easier for the linter. Avoid using solparse-antlr in your production systems.
